							<p>I currently work for the Arthur McDonald institute as an engineer. I am part of team, composed of many 
								disciplines around the world, that is designing and building particle detectors. Many of my colleagues are 
								in academia, so my engineering skill set is implemented in several ongoing experiments. This is great for 
								my development as an engineer because I am exposed to a wide variety of tasks and challenged with diverse 
								problems.  The three main experiments I work on are 
								<a href="https://www.picoexperiment.com/pico-500/">PICO-500</a>, 
								<a href="https://indico.fnal.gov/event/23110/contributions/190683/attachments/131688/161335/SBCs_10_kg_Argon_Bubble_Chambers.pdf">SBC</a>, and 
								<a href="https://news-g.org">News-G3</a>.</p>
							<p>PICO-500 and SBC are both bubble chambers, and they function off a similar principle. To have a working 
								bubble chamber you need: a superheated fluid; the ability to control temperature and the pressure of the 
								fluid; and sensors to detect when the fluid boils. A super-heated fluid is a fluid that is still a liquid 
								despite being hotter than its boiling point (Ex water at 110 Celsius). To create a super-heated fluid, 
								you need to remove all nucleation sites from the active volume. This means the container surface needs 
								to be smooth on a molecular level, with all impurities in the fluid removed.</p>
							<p>This active fluid wants to change state and boil, but it needs a nucleation site. When a particle 
								traveling through the volume collides/interacts, it will give the fluid enough energy to start boiling 
								at that location. The physics gets extracted from this experiment by recording how that energy is 
								transferred to the fluid ie. Number of bubbles, expansion rate, intensity etc. Once the fluid starts to 
								bubble and the sensors have recorded the event the system quickly pressurizes with piston(s). This 
								needs to be done to stop the active fluid from boiling completely. Once the pressure is above the 
								fluid’s boiling point, it’s no longer super-heated, and the boiling stops. The pressure is then 
								reduced again, putting the fluid back in the super-heated state, and the cycle is repeated. The 
								detectors are designed for millions of theses cycles in their lifetimes.</p>
							<p>Theses detectors are getting so sensitive that they can only be operated in special places that are 
								shielded from particles being generated from the sun. That is why both PICO-500 and SBC will be 
								located in <a href="https://www.snolab.ca">SNOLAB</a>, the world’s deepest clean lab in the world.</p>
							<p>As an engineer working on these projects, I complete a diverse portfolio of work. I have done extensive 
								work on the CAD models, designing physical components and systems as well as the 2D drawings for 
								fabrication. I have worked on many simulations in a variety of software and coding languages, 
								encompassing everything from modeling heat flow with FEA to ray tracing with MATLAB. This job has also 
								taught me a lot about ASME code and calculation out of necessity.</p>
