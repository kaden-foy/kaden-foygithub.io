							<h1>Couch Clip</h1>

							<p>One of the first projects where I iterated through different parameter to get the best 3D printed product was 
								a couch clip. It was designed to hold two sections of my couch together. The initial design was a simple L 
								bracket that was 25mm wide. This design was printed with PLA, using a 0.4mm nozzle and had a tri-hexagonal 
								infill of 50%. This clip design however broke after only a couple days of use. The break happened right at 
								the corner, as made sense. My next iteration I changed the infill to 100% and made the design 50mm wide. 
								This design lasted significantly longer, around a month before breaking at the same location.</p>
							<p>My design changed significantly at this point. I removed the sharp 90-degree corner with a rounded corner to 
								allow for less stress concentration and more “give” before breaking. Also, to increase print speed and 
								strengthen the print, a 0.8mm nozzle was used and the infill was set to trace out the outline of the clip, 
								removing any grain that would run parallel to the shear stresses. This clip design lasted over 6-months 
								until breaking. However, this time the clip broke due to “user error”, as someone tryied to move the couch 
								by pulling on the smaller couch section. This put roughly 150lbs of force on the clip. However, I suspect 
								what actually broke the clip was that the way the force was applied to the clip. The force was applied at 
								one edge cause a toque on the clip which concentrating all the stress to one side. I suspect this because 
								the clip mount, which is metal, had its screws partially ripped out of the couch in manner consistent with 
								a sideways load.</p>
							<p>The final design incorporates a curved face that contacts the main section of the couch. This should, in 
								theory, reduce the torque on the clip as the surface is normal to the point of contact.</p>
							<p>As a small exercise in FEA, I imported my latest design and tested it with 150lbs. My results showed that 
								the stress concentrated where the last design iteration failed. It also showed that the stresses, arguable 
								within the margin of error, were not high enough to break the clip. I suspect that if an FEA was competed 
								with additional torque, there would be a region that had high enough stress to cause a failure.</p>
							<p>As of today, the current iteration has not failed. A link to the Current CAD and STL file can be found on my
